               <h1>the necessity to start</h1>
               <p>
                  5 years ago, i was obsessed with a service where 2 matched
                  users would listen to music & chat together. there's a lady
                  having similar music preference with me. we spent hours
                  talking about music, life, world... in the end, i questioned
                  her "so what's the meaning of life". her answer was:
                  <scan class="highlight">to create</scan>. <br />
               </p>
               <div class="sidenote annotation">
                  back then, my interpretation is
                  <scan class="highlight">to brood</scan>. i was a metaphysical
                  teenager.
               </div>
               <p>
                  the fact is that, i've been indulging in depression &
                  corruption these 5 years, absolutely wasting my time & doing
                  nothing. <br />
                  i have serious bipolar disorder and i've been medicated for 3
                  years. i try to take the minimum dose of quetiapine but
                  still, my thinking ability and intelligence have been hugely
                  affected. <br />
                  and three years ago, i started to abuse llms. llms make me
                  think less, write less, lazier and lazier, dumber and dumber.
                  i've lost my creativity. <br />
                  well. i must make a change. i must start to work more, write
                  more, create more. i must abandon brooding and llms. and the
                  situation is that, i don't know what to do. i know a little
                  about computer-science & data-science but that's all. <br />
                  this will be a long journey. but at least, i need to record
                  it from the very beginning. <br />
               </p>
               <h1>what do i need to start</h1>
               <p>so, let's clear our mind one more time.</p>
               <div class="list-1">i want to create something</div>
               <div class="list-1">
                  i don't know what to create specifically for now
               </div>
               <div class="list-1">
                  i'd like to record all i learn & do through the journey
               </div>
               <p>
                  my plan is to explore one little subject/project per 2~3
                  weeks. i'd like to make a video & a blogpost for every this
                  little subject. <br />
                  first of all, i need something that helps with video
                  presentation & blog creation. or generally, something that
                  helps with writing. the idea is simple: i just write
                  presentation & blog in a text format and write a compiler to
                  transform it to html webpage or other formats. <br />
                  and the final solution is intuitive: crafting my custom
                  markup language, stoa. <br />
               </p>
               <div class="sidenote annotation">
                  before crafting my own markup language, i wrote a compiler
                  that transforms a neorg<a

               </div>
               <h1>starting from the philosophy implantation</h1>
               <p>
                  the philosophy is based on this fundamental question: in what
                  i want to reside in? <br />
                  i care about my sanity most. so i hope this language can
                  formulate a feeling of calm, immersive, pure, serene, a
                  feeling of zen. <br />
               </p>
               <div class="sidenote annotation">
                  i have many metaphors & descriptors for the implatation:
                  holy-minimalism, metaphysical-minimalism, ... anyway, you can
                  sense that <scan class="highlight">minimalism</scan> is the
                  central doctrine.
               </div>
               <p>
                  essentially, stoa is inspired by markdown and neorg. and the
                  philosophy is basically based on what i dislike about neorg
                  and markdown. <br />
               </p>
               <h2>minimalism above all</h2>
               <p>
                  i'll only add a feature when it's absolutely necessary.
                  <br />
                  the kinds of blocks i need can be easily listed: paragraph,
                  heading, (unordered) list, codeblock, mathblock, footnote and
                  sidenote. i also need some inline elements: links and
                  markups, where i only need
                  <scan class="inlinecode">inlinecode</scan> and
                  <scan class="highlight">highlight</scan> for markups. plus
                  metadata, these are the whole building blocks of stoa. <br />
                  this makes up a 47 lines grammar of stoa. <br />
               </p>
               <h2>independent of text editors</h2>
               <p>
                  stoa should work identically across all text editors. this
                  means zero editor-specific features like syntax highlighting,
                  real-time rendering, extensions, over-engineered building
                  blocks and more. <br />
               </p>
               <h2>strictness</h2>
               <p>
                  stoa is intentionally strict. there's exactly one way to do
                  each thing. <br />
                  compare markdown's multiple list syntaxes: <br />
               </p>
               <div class="code-block">
                  <pre><code>* a list
+ a list  
- a list
</code></pre>
                  <span class="code-lang">markdown</span>
               </div>
               <p><br /></p>
               <div class="list-1">in stoa, there's always only one way.</div>
               <h1>
                  lexical structure: columns, inlines and continuation rules
               </h1>
               <p>
                  stoa is built on two fundamental concepts: columns and
                  inlines. <br />
                  a column is the abstract building block and inlines are
                  semantic decorations within columns. we use minimal
                  delimiters to identify these columns and markups strictly.
                  <br />
                  here's the full grammar of stoa: <br />
               </p>
