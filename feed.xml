         <description><![CDATA[<h1>ai summary (claude4-sonnet-thinking)</h1><p>this blogpost is a companion of my <a href='https://youtu.be/We63OxWJNZw?si=YjUOYFYJzgEPgWRS' target=_blank>video on stoa</a> <br/> i'm documenting the starting point of my creative journey after 5 years of depression and mental health struggles. <br/> medicated for bipolar disorder and having become overly dependent on llms, i've lost much of my creativity and thinking ability. <br/> i've decided to break this cycle by committing to create, learn, and document everything along the way. <br/> to support this journey, i've built my own markup language called "stoa" - inspired by the philosophy of minimalism, editor independence, and strictness. <br/> unlike complex languages like neorg, stoa can be learned in 10 minutes with just 47 lines of grammar. <br/> it's designed around two core concepts: columns and inlines, processed by a single-pass compiler written in nim. <br/> the technical implementation uses finite state machines to parse different column types (headings, lists, sidenotes, etc.) and processes files line by line without building complex asts. <br/> this reflects my broader philosophy of holy-minimalism and metaphysical elegance. <br/> this post marks my commitment to abandon brooding and dependency, start creating meaningful work, and help my family live better. <br/> i hope sharing this journey might help others facing similar struggles with mental health and creative paralysis. <br/></p>]]></description>
