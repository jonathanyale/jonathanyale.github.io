                           <h1>the necessity to start</h1>
                           <p>
                              5 years ago, i was obsessed with a service where
                              2 matched users would listen to music & chat
                              together. there's a lady having similar music
                              preference with me. we spent hours talking about
                              music, life, world... in the end, i questioned
                              her "so what's the meaning of life". her answer
                              was: <scan class="highlight">to create</scan>.
                              <br />
                           </p>
                           <div class="sidenote annotation">
                              back then, my interpretation is
                              <scan class="highlight">to brood</scan>. i was a
                              metaphysical teenager.
                           </div>
                           <p>
                              the fact is that, i've been indulging in
                              depression & corruption these 5 years, absolutely
                              wasting my time & doing nothing. <br />
                              i have serious bipolar disorder and i've been
                              medicated for 3 years. i try to take the minimum
                              dose of quetiapine but still, my thinking ability
                              and intelligence have been hugely affected.
                              <br />
                              and three years ago, i started to abuse llms.
                              llms make me think less, write less, lazier and
                              lazier, dumber and dumber. i've lost my
                              creativity. <br />
                              well. i must make a change. i must start to work
                              more, write more, create more. i must abandon
                              brooding and llms. and the situation is that, i
                              don't know what to do. i know a little about
                              computer-science & data-science but that's all.
                              <br />
                              this will be a long journey. but at least, i need
                              to record it from the very beginning. <br />
                           </p>

                           <p>so, let's clear our mind one more time.</p>
